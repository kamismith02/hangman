# Hangman Game in C++

## Overview

As a software engineer, I developed a Hangman game in C++ to further my understanding of the language and its object-oriented programming features. This project demonstrates how to implement basic game logic while leveraging C++ features like classes, conditionals, loops, and functions. The purpose of this software is to practice the core concepts of C++ and showcase how to build an interactive command-line game that uses fundamental programming principles, such as variables, expressions, and loops, to create a functioning game experience.

## Development Environment

To develop this Hangman game, I used the **C++ programming language** along with the **MinGW** compiler (for Windows) to compile and run the program. The project relies on basic C++ libraries for I/O operations. I used Visual Studio Code as my development environment with the necessary C++ extensions installed to provide syntax highlighting and build support. The game logic is implemented using object-oriented principles, and the **Standard Template Library (STL)** was not used extensively, but I opted to keep it simple for the purpose of learning basic language features.

## Useful Websites

Here are some resources I found helpful during the project:

- [C++ Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B)
- [W3Schools C++ Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/)
- [CPlusPlus STL Reference](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/)

## Future Work

There are a few areas where this Hangman game can be improved in the future:

- **Improve user input validation**: Currently, the input handling is basic, and additional validation can be added to ensure better error handling.
- **Enhance the user interface**: A more engaging interface (such as displaying graphics or animated hangman) can be created in the future using a graphical library like SDL or SFML.
- **Extend the game functionality**: Features like tracking high scores, adding difficulty levels, or allowing users to input their own word can be added to increase the game's complexity and replayability.
